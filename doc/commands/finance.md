## Amort

Amortizes a loan or investment based upon the current amortization settings.
Values must be stored in the TVM variables (`I%Yr`, `PV`, `Pmt`, and `PYr`). The
number of payments `n` is taken from the input together with flag â€“14
(`TVMPayAtBeginningOfPeriod` / `TVMPayAtEndOfPeriod`).

Given the number of payments `n`, the command deposits the value of the
principal, interest and balance in stack levels 1, 2 and 3.
